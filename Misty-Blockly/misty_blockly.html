        Although group projects are great for getting a general understanding of topics. It is during the individual assignments that people
        expand on what is interesting to them.<br>

        <br>

        The prompt for the individual assignments is as follows:<br>
        For this first artifact, you individually must propose something you want to implement and video-record by controlling the Misty II
        robot with the Blockly programming method. Your artifact should not be identical to anything from the team assignment or anyone else's
        individual artifact in the class; use this opportunity to try something out with the Misty robot that interests you.

          Recording the song took more space than I thought it would which is why the video is so compressed.

          Task 1 was the introduction to MistyRobotics. This was also an exposure to how tempermental the Misty Robots can be. <br>

          <br>

          After reading <a href="https://lessons.mistyrobotics.com/blockly/blockly-lessons/lesson-1-movement">Blockly Lesson 1</a> we were to implement the following promt.<br>
          Assume that Misty wants to cross a “busy street.” Using each type of robot movement (arm, head, drive) at least once, program Misty to
          cross the street in an expressive way. Assume it takes Misty 6 seconds to cross the street at velocity 20.<br>

          <br>

          After reading <a href="https://lessons.mistyrobotics.com/blockly/blockly-lessons/lesson-2-voice-and-sound">Blockly Lesson 2</a> we were to implement the following promt.<br>
          While expressive motion is helpful, sometimes being verbal can add to an interaction! Accordingly, have Misty say something as it crosses
          the street (school-appropriate, please!). This prompt is open-ended, so try to create a story with your program! For example, did Misty almost get hit by a car?
          Did Misty decide to thank cars that stopped?<br>

          <br>

          After reading <a href="https://lessons.mistyrobotics.com/blockly/blockly-lessons/lesson-3-expressions">Blockly Lesson 3</a> we were to implement the following promt.<br>
          Now let's add some sound once Misty finishes its walk, as well as some warning lights! We will do this as follows.
          <ol>
            <li>
                Add a completion sound once Misty finishes crossing the street (again, school-appropriate, please). You can either upload your own sound OR use one of the
                pre-installed sounds available with the robot.
              </li>
            <li>When Misty is moving, make Misty flash a Red LED, and when Misty finishes crossing, have Misty display a green LED.</li>
          </ol>
        </p>

        <p>
          Task 2 was the most challenging of the 3 tasks. Misty's movement may be tempermental, but the time of flight sensors are so much worse. It took many attempts to
          record the video below.<br>

          <br>

          After reading <a href="https://lessons.mistyrobotics.com/blockly/blockly-lessons/lesson-5-events">Blockly Lesson 5</a> we were to implement the following prompt.<br>
          Implement an event that allows Misty to stop before hitting any object. Misty should sense nearby objects and acknowledge a close call by doing the
          following two things:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Verbally warn that it is too close to an object.</li>
          <li>Move back or stop to avoid hitting the object.</li>
        </ol>

        <br>

        <p>
          Implement an event that will warn any human passer-by that the robot is heading toward them. 
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>You can use either object or face detection for this task! The distance the teaching team found to work for face detection was about 2.8 meters.</li>
          <li>Misty should verbally warn the detected person of its approach.</li>
        </ol>

        <br>

        <p>
          Implement an event that will make Misty move in a desired direction.<br>
          To do this part of the task, have Misty respond to the touch sensors in its head.<br>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>If the left side of the head is pressed, have Misty move to the left.</li>
          <li>If the right side is touched, have Misty move to the right.</li>
          <li>If the chin is touched, have Misty move forward.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          To indicate the direction of movement have Misty either say that it is moving in that direction OR signal with an LED light of your choosing that corresponds to that direction.<br>
          
          <br>
          
          You should have Misty change expressions as well, depending on the direction of travel AND events like Misty stopping!
        </p>

        <p>
          Our team noticed that the oporational range was often between 1 meters and 1.5 meters. Further distances often resulted in errors or no readings at all.
          It should be noted that this video needed to be rerecorded and thus due to time constraints did not show the chin/head responses. The code that was checked off has allow
          3 features implemented.

          After completing <a href="https://lessons.mistyrobotics.com/blockly/blockly-lessons/lesson-8-nlp">Blockly Lesson 8</a> we were to implement the following prompt.<br>

          <br>

          Using NLP, you will either make Misty respond to the question “Did I (Misty) do a job?” OR have Misty tell an interactive joke.
          For the first task option, if the answer is “No,” have Misty perform a set of actions (this is up to you, but options could include acting sad or trying again).
          For the first option, if the answer is “Yes,” have Misty perform a set of actions (again, up to you, but options could include a witty remark or victory dance).<br>
          
          <br>
          
          For the second task option, Misty should deliver a joke, observe information about the human onlooker's face or audio, and then do something in response according
          to the observation. The design of this response is open-ended, but could include options like commenting on the person's reaction, trying to save the joke, or
          capitalizing on success by telling another similar joke.

          You'll notice that I had to repeat myself. Although a more optimal recording could have been made, this shows the alternative message for if no voice is detected in its recording.
