          Although group projects are great for getting a general understanding of topics. It is during the individual assignments that people
          expand on what is interesting to them.<br>

          <br>

          The prompt for the individual assignments is as follows:<br>
          For this first artifact, you individually must propose something you want to implement and video-record by controlling the Misty II
          robot with the Blockly programming method. Your artifact should not be identical to anything from the team assignment or anyone else's
          individual artifact in the class; use this opportunity to try something out with the Misty robot that interests you.

            <p>For this Misty project, I implemented "Misty Day Out," where Misty can detect humans and say "Good morning" whenever it passes a person. 
              Misty will also have a brief conversation with the person. The way it works is that Misty moves around, and when it detects a human, it will interact with them.

            <p>This artifact was performed to determine the capabilities of the Misty II robot's NLP functions. The Misty robot has facial recognition and language
              processing actions so each of the team members were registered in the robot's known faces and conversation contexts were create for each. The program was
              written using the Misty II's Blockly language. This language was a little more structured than python or another programming language, however the robot
              was able to recognize each of the members and enact the respective conversations. If this project was continued, then additional troubleshooting would have
              been conducted to hone the transitions between speaking.

              My main goal for this artifact was to explore the motion capabilities of Misty and partially control it through NLP.
              My plan was to use voice commands to control the speed of the robot, and then use capacitive touch to signal misty to turn.<br>

              <br>

              Unfortunately, I had to pivot midway through the project due to the NLP data not transferring correctly to Misty. In my final version, 
              I use the back bump sensors instead of NLP to control Misty's speed. I also used the front bump sensors as an end state, simulating Misty hitting something and being unable to proceed.

              Task 1 was the introduction to MistyRobotics. This was also an exposure to how tempermental the Misty Robots can be.<br>

              <br>

              After reading <a href="https://lessons.mistyrobotics.com/blockly/blockly-lessons/lesson-1-movement">Blockly Lesson 1</a> we were to implement the following promt.<br>
              Assume that Misty wants to cross a “busy street.” Using each type of robot movement (arm, head, drive) at least once, program Misty to
              cross the street in an expressive way. Assume it takes Misty 6 seconds to cross the street at velocity 20.<br>

              <br>

              After reading <a href="https://lessons.mistyrobotics.com/blockly/blockly-lessons/lesson-2-voice-and-sound">Blockly Lesson 2</a> we were to implement the following promt.<br>
              While expressive motion is helpful, sometimes being verbal can add to an interaction! Accordingly, have Misty say something as it crosses
              the street (school-appropriate, please!). This prompt is open-ended, so try to create a story with your program! For example, did Misty almost get hit by a car?
              Did Misty decide to thank cars that stopped?<br>

              <br>

              After reading <a href="https://lessons.mistyrobotics.com/blockly/blockly-lessons/lesson-3-expressions">Blockly Lesson 3</a> we were to implement the following promt.<br>
              Now let's add some sound once Misty finishes its walk, as well as some warning lights! We will do this as follows.
              <ol>
                <li>
                    Add a completion sound once Misty finishes crossing the street (again, school-appropriate, please). You can either upload your own sound OR use one of the
                    pre-installed sounds available with the robot.
                  </li>
                <li>When Misty is moving, make Misty flash a Red LED, and when Misty finishes crossing, have Misty display a green LED.</li>
              </ol>
            </p>

            <p>
              Task 2 was the most challenging of the 3 tasks. Misty's movement may be tempermental, but the time of flight sensors are so much worse. It took many attempts to
              record the video below.<br>

              <br>

              After reading <a href="https://lessons.mistyrobotics.com/blockly/blockly-lessons/lesson-5-events">Blockly Lesson 5</a> we were to implement the following prompt.<br>
              Implement an event that allows Misty to stop before hitting any object. Misty should sense nearby objects and acknowledge a close call by doing the
              following two things:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Verbally warn that it is too close to an object.</li>
              <li>Move back or stop to avoid hitting the object.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
              Implement an event that will warn any human passer-by that the robot is heading toward them. 
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>You can use either object or face detection for this task! The distance the teaching team found to work for face detection was about 2.8 meters.</li>
              <li>Misty should verbally warn the detected person of its approach.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
              Implement an event that will make Misty move in a desired direction.<br>
              To do this part of the task, have Misty respond to the touch sensors in its head.<br>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>If the left side of the head is pressed, have Misty move to the left.</li>
              <li>If the right side is touched, have Misty move to the right.</li>
              <li>If the chin is touched, have Misty move forward.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              To indicate the direction of movement have Misty either say that it is moving in that direction OR signal with an LED light of your choosing that corresponds to that direction.<br>
              
              <br>
              
              You should have Misty change expressions as well, depending on the direction of travel AND events like Misty stopping!
            </p>

            <p>
              Our team noticed that the oporational range was often between 1 meters and 1.5 meters. Further distances often resulted in errors or no readings at all.
              It should be noted that this video needed to be rerecorded and thus due to time constraints did not show the chin/head responses. The code that was checked off has allow
              3 features implemented.

              After completing <a href="https://lessons.mistyrobotics.com/blockly/blockly-lessons/lesson-8-nlp">Blockly Lesson 8</a> we were to implement the following prompt.<br>

              <br>

              Using NLP, you will either make Misty respond to the question “Did I (Misty) do a job?” OR have Misty tell an interactive joke.
              For the first task option, if the answer is “No,” have Misty perform a set of actions (this is up to you, but options could include acting sad or trying again).
              For the first option, if the answer is “Yes,” have Misty perform a set of actions (again, up to you, but options could include a witty remark or victory dance).<br>
              
              <br>
              
              For the second task option, Misty should deliver a joke, observe information about the human onlooker's face or audio, and then do something in response according
              to the observation. The design of this response is open-ended, but could include options like commenting on the person's reaction, trying to save the joke, or
              capitalizing on success by telling another similar joke.
            </p>

            <p>
              You'll notice that I had to repeat myself. Although a more optimal recording could have been made, this shows the alternative message for if no voice is detected in its recording.
