    <h2>Pupper-Race</h2>
    <div class="section">
      <p>
        For the pupper races, our TA wanted to show us <a href="https://github.com/raff17/pupper-intro-code">a few easy ways</a> to move the bot without
        needing to get into ros.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Controlling the servo's directly using kinematics mathematics.</li>
        <li>Using the same code that responds to the PS4 controller to tell the pupper how to move.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <div class="section">
        <button onclick="toggle_visibility('Task_1', this)" class="expandable plus">Task 1 (May 9, 2024)</button>
        <div class="hidden btn_group" id="Task_1">
          <p>
            Using pupper-intro-code/StanfordQuadrupedmini_pupper/src/leg_move.py we used the pwm{num} to target specific servo's.
            The back legs and the front legs have positive angles mapped toward the center of the bot. Despite this we got the diagonal legs to move
            pretty close to together. Since we only had to mimic walking on one leg and we were mimicking walking on all 4 legs, we did not bother
            worrying about the height of the back legs.
          </p>

          <p>
            The careful observer will notice that the back left left's thigh is not moving properly. This was due to a burned out motor.
            We unfortunately had to go immidiately from this checkoff to the class race.

      <div class="section">
        <button onclick="toggle_visibility('Task_2', this)" class="expandable plus">Task 2 (May 9, 2024)</button>
        <div class="hidden btn_group" id="Task_2">
          <p>
            Using pupper-intro-code/PS4Joystick/easycontrol.py we mimiced the controller inputs to make the pupper move with only Python.
            The pupper was given an initial launch command and then it needed to get over the finish line. Although originally there was supposed
            to be a maze, the TA and instructor recognized that there was not enough time for teams to develop an acurate enough walking and turning mechanism.<br>

            <br>

            Our team had designed a somewhat precise move by degrees and move by feet, but drift and the bad servo put all of that out the window during the race.
            Luckily the pupper got caught on the floor enough times to get it going in the correct direction (finishing first for Monday's group).<br>

            <br>

            Although the rear left servo was malfunctioning, the stars aligned and enough self course corrections resulted in a winning bot.

          <p>There were more than a few quirky things related to the ps4 joystick controls via Python.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Movement drift.</li>
            <li>More than 1 command required to activate and deactivate.</li>
            <li>Activation and Trotting are toggled (not held constant), but movement commands must be repeated.</li>
            <li>Activate and then trot in order to move.</li>
            <li>A delay of .02 seconds moves the bot faster.</li>
            <li>There is a setting which will make the pupper move faster.</li>
            <li>Having the yellow asthetic pieces are actually not good for the servo's in testing.</li>
            <li>Calibration height can be lowered to lower center of mass.</li>
            <li>Ros twist commands are much better for handling movement.</li>
          </ul>
