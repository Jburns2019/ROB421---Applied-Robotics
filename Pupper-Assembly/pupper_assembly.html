    <h1>Pupper-Assembly</h1>
    <p>
      The mini-puppers are a step in a completely different direction of the Misty II bots.<br>
      The Misty bots run on tracks, the puppers are quadruped.<br>
      The Misty bot code is closed to the public with no transparency and no chance for improvement or adjustment. The mini-pupper code is open source
      and the development team is easily accessible via their discord.<br>
      The Misty bot uses a beginner safety first approach to robotics interaction. You can and are encouraged to experiment as much as you like with the
      mini-puppers.<br>

      <br>

      A part of this do it yourself approach is that the puppers are shipped in parts. We needed to put them together using the TA guide,
      <a href="https://minipupperdocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/Assembly.html">online guide</a>, and
      and common sense. Although I am not typically a huge fan of putting kits together for school, putting together the puppers yourself is imperitive to
      future debugging. Servo fails? What is the least number of pieces that need to be removed to replace said servo? What joints control what? A screw fell out,
      where does it go based on its size and where screws should be. All of these questions will need to be answered at some point in any extended development. <br>

      <br>

      The next part of the process is to setup the software for the pupper. As to be expected with first interactions with such sophisticated software, there is a
      lot to be taken in. Problems from poking around to hard is to be expected. Luckily MangDang's
      <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RXu8dGXx3duYmF6jz4DYGml95TujSjsq">prebuilt iso</a>'s make the stakes low.

        The pupper was the first robot that we were able to take home with us. This massively increased the amount of hours that the team could put into projects.
        Although constructing the pupper can be done by a single inexperienced person in ~6 distracted hours, 3 people can complete the pupper in under 2 hours.<br>

        <br>

        It is my recomendation that a 3 person group splits the work up into:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Legs</li>
        <li>Servos</li>
        <li>Body and Leg Support</li>
      </ul>

    <div class="hidden btn_group" id="Working_Demo">
      <p>
        Once the pupper is fully constructed we needed to show that we had the pupper in a usable state. Again all of these steps proved to be
        invaluable for future investigation and debugging.

      <ol>
        <li>
          Flash the micro-sd with the desired iso file (minipupper_ros2_Humble was the iso we use). This can be done with
          <a href="https://etcher.balena.io/">belena etcher</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Setup wifi. You will need a keyboard initially.
          <ol class="nested">
            <li>Use `sudo vim /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml`.</li>
            <li>Add your ssid and password.</li>
            <li>Use `sudo netplan apply`.</li>
            <li>Use `sudo reboot` to apply network changes.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Ensure you have the proper repositories. If you do not, clone the repos and then run their install files.</li>
        <li>
          Check if the calibrate file exists. If it does not, you'll need to run the install file in the mini_pupper_bsp again. As the calibration file
          is setup after the dkms installations are checked, dkms cannot be installed. The process feels very janky, but it has worked to reset the calibration
          file on both Monday Team 1's and Wednesday Team 2's pupper.
          <ol class="nested">
            <li>Check dkms with `dkms status`.</li>
            <li>Remove all 3 dkms types with `sudo dkms remove name/1.0 --all`</li>
            <li>Run the mini_pupper_bsp install file. It will likely fail on an os check.</li>
            <li>Run it again.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          Run a movement scheme. Either the <a href="https://github.com/mangdangroboticsclub/PS4Joystick">PS4 Joystick</a> movement scheme
          or the <a href="https://github.com/mangdangroboticsclub/mini_pupper_ros">ros2 teleop_twist_keyboard</a> movement scheme.
        </li>
      </ol>
