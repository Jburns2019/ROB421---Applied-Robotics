        The prompt for the individual assignments is as follows:<br>
        For this artifact, you individually must propose something you want to implement and video-record by controlling the Misty II robot
        with the Python programming method. Your artifact should not be identical to anything from the team assignment or anyone else's
        individual artifact in the class; use this opportunity to try something out with the Misty robot that interests you.<br>

          Misty Python allows for more control, but more control still does not fix the movement hardware problems. Although I initially
          wanted to make something like the naive exploration of a roomba. I eventually scrapped the idea and pursued something more creative.
          Opporating under the assumption that the misty bot's face would allow picture updates, I started working on a chess game.
          As using my computer for partial processing was acceptable, I planned to use Misty for NLP, display, and speach interaction.<br>

          <br>

          Unfortunately, images could not be uploaded to misty's face. This was definitely something I should have checked before on the chess
          simulation over the weekend. The chess game is capable of 2 autonomous players, 1 autonomous to 1 manual player, and 2 manual players.
          The chess board is interacted with by speech and visualized on the computer screen.

        A return to Misty, but with Python instead of Visual Programming. This was intended as a first exposure of Python to robotics.

          We were to implement the following prompts.<br>

          <br>
          
          Using the same “busy street” scenario, make Misty move forward for 5 seconds, turn around, wait 3 seconds, and return to
          their starting position. As you would when crossing the road (hopefully) make sure that Misty also looks both ways when
          crossing the road, as well as uses their arms movement at least once. Sometimes Misty will have trouble moving in one direction,
          so if you are having trouble with Misty moving just switch directions.<br>

          <br>

          To the previous code you created (Misty crossing the road), we will now add a way for Misty to communicate with others and signal
          when it is walking or stopped. In the robotics world this is the bare minimum you should implement on a robot if it is going to
          interact with humans in any way!
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Have Misty say something using the speak command! This can be anything you want to be creative with
            it (school-appropriate, please!).
          </li>
          <li>
            Have Misty signal when it stops by displaying a red light and green when Misty is moving. You can assume that when Misty
            is turning the LED will remain green.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <br>

        <p>
          Now let’s have Misty display a new pair of eyes that fit the scenario you put Misty in! For example, if it was Misty's
          first time crossing the road they might be excited and happy!

        <ul>
