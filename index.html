        The course description of robotics 421 is "Multidisciplinary teams of students design, build, and demonstrate a robotic system, including all sensing, computation, and actuation.
        The specific task, such as checkers-playing robots, changes each year, and is designed to be challenging for ambitious students. Robots will compete in a friendly competition at
        the end of the term."<br>

        <br>

        The class was almost entirely composed of Mechanical Engineers. The focus of the class was to give exposure to robotics in a format that many different skill levels could find
        education in. This meant there was always work to be done. John had the most experience in team 1 with software, which made some of the early tasks a breeze. Though this was
        tempered by the ever present challenges of working with any software-hardware interaction. The more one knows about coding, the deeper into the rabit hole they can go.<br>

        <br>

        Join us as we dip our toes into the robotics world. Professor Fitter and Rafael were kind enough to give us some demo steps, showing us where our interests were before requesting
        a 4 week project using one of the robots available.

    <h2>Misty</h2>

        <p>
            <a href="https://www.mistyrobotics.com">MistyRobotics</a> have created a safe, first exposure to robotics. This safety first approach causes there to be a lot of limitations that
            can take a lot of effort to circumvent. This was furthered by no access to the code base. Though, at the end of the term, an issue was found with the misty-bots being outdated.
            Reportedly updating the repositories fixed the severe tempermental time-of-flight, movement, and NLP issues.

            <a href="https://www.mangdang.net/">MangDang</a>, creator of the Mini-Pupper, have packaged a group of robotics software into a quadruped capable of nearly lifelike movement.
            Though they are in constant development, the powerful tools and base systems allow for limitless creativity. As a drawback, the mini-pupper's have a lot of breaking points.
            Complex and interesting problems can arise from either the software or the hardware.
