            <p><a href="https://www.mangdang.net/">MangDang</a>, creator of the Mini-Pupper, have packaged a group of robotics software into a quadruped capable of nearly lifelike movement. Though they are in constant development, the powerful tools and base systems allow for limitless creativity. As a drawback, the mini-pupper's have a lot of breaking points. Complex and interesting problems can arise from either the software or the hardware.</p>
