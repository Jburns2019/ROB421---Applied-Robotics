        Our final project is focused on using the Mini Pupper robot to implement SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping). The goal is to enable the robot to autonomously navigate and map its environment, enhancing its capability to perform complex tasks. Below, you'll find detailed information about our proposal, demo videos, and updates on our progress.

            Our final project proposal is to use the Mini Pupper robot to map a room using SLAM. Mapping and localization is an important problem to solve for many robotic systems. Giving the Mini Pupper the ability to localize itself and map its surroundings would further its capabilities of performing more complicated tasks autonomously.

                We gave a presentation intended to pitch our idea to our professor and to further investigate the tools we intend to use for the project. We've decided on the Mini Pupper robot for our SLAM system. We are using ROS to give us more SLAM capabilities and access to twist commands for more accurate robot movement. For hardware, we are using a innomaker LiDAR unit and the existing servos on the Pupper. Rviz is used to visualize the LiDAR data.

                This video demonstrates the keyboard simulation for the Mini Pupper. In this simulation, we show how the keyboard can be used to control the Mini Pupper's movements, which is essential for our mapping tasks. We utilize RViz as part of the simulation to visualize the LiDAR data and ensure accurate mapping of the room. This setup allows us to manually guide the Mini Pupper through the environment, collecting data for the SLAM system to create a detailed map.<br>

                This video showcases our ability to map a simulation environment for the Mini Pupper. Using ROS 2 and Gazebo, which is a robot simulation environment, we were able to interact with and control the Mini Pupper. Gazebo can be used independently or integrated with ROS 2 using a set of packages. In this simulation, we utilized keyboard commands embedded within ROS 2 to control the robot and map its surroundings. The visualized map is displayed using RViz, demonstrating our progress in achieving accurate mapping through simulation.<br>

                This video was created for fun to demonstrate the Mini Pupper running in circles. Using RViz, we recorded the simulation of the Mini Pupper executing circular movements. Once completed, we put the robot into a continuous loop, showcasing its ability to perform repetitive tasks accurately within the simulated environment. For fun, we used it as a loading screen.<br>

                This artifact was used to further the team's end-of-term project. Using the ROS 2 repository with the Mini Pupper, the team used a provided program. The team's goal with the project was to generate a map using SLAM on the Mini Pupper. This potentially enhanced the movement of the Mini Pupper, introducing more movements for each servo of the robot. The Mini Pupper performed a series of movements and created a dance routine along with a song. This artifact uses Colcon build to rebuild new packages of ROS 2.<br>

                This artifact was used to further the team's end of term project. Using ROS2 repository with the Mini Pupper had the team use a provided program to manually control the robot using a computer keyboard. The team's goal with the project was to generate a map using SLAM on the pupper. This would potentially require the pupper to turn a certain amount. The artifact had modified that provided code to turn the Mini Pupper 90 degrees in either the clockwise or counter directions. This will better enable the team to move the robot and generate SLAM maps. Leading the team forward to attempt developing autonomous movement to generate additional area maps.<br>

                My goal for this project was to figure out how to efficiently move and turn the Mini Pupper after the recent update to run it using ROS. Based on a movement program for twist commands in the existing Mini Pupper ROS repository, I created my own that had the robot move forward, turn 180 degrees, and then return to its starting position. The robot was fairly stable and consistent going forward, but I did have some difficulty turning the robot exactly 180 degrees as is apparent in the video. I found there was a decent amount of variability in how much the Mini Pupper would turn each time while running the same program. I hope to be able to develop a more robust system for turning later on.<br>

                This video demonstrates the LiDAR module in ROS 2. The Mini Pupper is mounted with a MANGDANG STL-06P LiDAR module, which performs well as intended. The LiDAR system uses laser pulses to measure distances to surrounding objects, creating a detailed 3D map of the environment. The video shows lines of different colors signifying various objects detected by the LiDAR. The darker the color, the more likely it is recognized as a solid object. This color coding helps in distinguishing between different types of objects and understanding their solidity. The LiDAR data is visualized in RViz, a 2D visualization tool for ROS, which allows us to see the environment from the robot's perspective and ensures accurate mapping and obstacle detection.<br>
